# Poster Showcase

## Ab-Initio 3D Model
The presented model results from the Ab-Initio simulation of a slab of SBA-15 grafted with APTES.\

You can see the formation of covalent bonds between the amines and silanol groups, as a proton is shared between them.

## Gas Adsorption
Grand Canonical Monte Carlo (GCMC) was used to perform gas adsorption studies in COFs and Silica slit pores.

## Molecular Dynamics
Molecular Dynamics simulations were performed on two 2D COFs.\
The NVE ensemble trajectory can be seen in the following GIFs.\
The sheets are represented in different colors for clearer visualization.\
CO2 is represented in gray and red, for C and O, respectively.
### COF-42
Hydrogens were removed for clearer visualization.
