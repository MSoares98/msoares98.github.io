# Short Bio  
I got my B.Sc. in Biotechnology and a M.Sc. degree in Clinical Biochemistry, both from the University of Aveiro. During my B.Sc. degree, I was co-author of a paper on the impact of rare earth elements in bivalves. My master's dissertation on "Molecular Modelling of chloride recognition and transmembrane transport by hydrazone-based synthetic receptors" yielded valuable results for the publication of a paper on the role of hydrazones as anion transporters. On 2021 I studied the dissolution of lignin in mixtures of water and deep euthetic solvents, resourting to molecular dynamics simulations, within the scope of a research grant from Project InPaCTus.\
On November 2022, I started my Ph.D. studies on Team Specko (ERC PhD Grant) under the supervision of Dr. Luís Mafra, Dr. Mariana Sardo and Dr. Ildefonso Marín-Montesinos. My research focuses on the use of NMR and MAS-DNP methodology to characterize adsorbed gas species in porous material, as well as performing computer modelling studies in close synergy with the synthesis of said materials. 

# Scientific Interests 
The main topics of research include:
1. Design, development and application of NMR and MAS-DNP methodology to characterize adsorbed gas species in porous materials
2. Perform computer modelling studies in close synergy with the synthesis of the materials
3. Perform numerical simulations of MAS-DNP to assist the design, development and application of the methodology developed in the first topic, towards assessing the performance of the required polarizing agents.
